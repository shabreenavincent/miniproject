# Pancreatic Cancer Detection Using CT Scans And Biomarkers

This project uses AI to detect pancreatic cancer by analyzing CT scans and biomarker data, generating integrated diagnostic reports. It aims to improve early detection and support clinical decision-making.


# About
The current study evaluates an AI-based model for pancreatic cancer diagnosis employing a dual approach through CT scans and biomarker processing. The proposed system processes images to detect abnormal objects and biomarker levels to identify deviations from a normal range. Both analyses will be integrated into a single diagnostic report. A centralized database contains and securely stores patient data and test results, along with reports for efficient access by doctors in reviewing these reports and making appropriate recommendations for the next step in the diagnosis or treatment. Early detection, greater accuracy in diagnosis, and improved quality of clinical decision-making are among the benefits expected from this approach.
